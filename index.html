          Dogecache is a mobile-first web app inspired by the concept of Geocaching. In the game of Geocaching, people experience scavenger hunts by finding objects that are planted by other players, and at the same time they plant their own objects for people to find. It's a game about finding and giving. In Dogecache, people search for dogecoin in their area while giving away dogecoin. By searching the area around them, users can pick up dogecoin within their radius but also has to drop off dogecoin where they are located. This way, dogecoin is always kept in circulation of the Dogecache app, and the game never ends. This app was a hack made at the hackathon at Bergen County Academies. It won the "Most Polished App", in addition to "Best Quality Design App" by Intel. Dogecache was also given a special invitation to debut at NYC Techday, New York City's largest tech startup exhibition (and with Dogecache, it includes high schoolers for the first time)!
