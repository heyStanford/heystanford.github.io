  "Hackathon" : '<div style="margin-bottom:20px">On March 22 and 23, my friends and I attended a hackathon at Bergen County Academies High School, NJ. The product of our efforts here culminated in an app we call <b>Dogecache</b>, a spin-off of the popular activity Geocaching. Geocaching is a global scavenger hunt where players look for objects that others have dropped, and acquire them by leaving behind one of their possessions, thus continuing the cycle. Dogecache replaces these objects with the <b>popular electronic crypto-currency, Dogecoin</b>. With the Dogecahce app, a player can choose to search an area around them for dogecoin. If they find any, they keep it, but for every search, they must drop off a certain amount of dogecoin of their choice at their current location so others can find it. This app won the special <b>"Most Polished App"</b> award and the <b>"Best Quality Mobile Web App"</b>  as awarded by Intel and a panel of judges including Alex Ohanion, cofounder of Reddit, and Colin Kroll, cofounder of Vine! Our team was also invited to exhibit our app at Techday in New York City, the largest startup event in the area (with over 10,000 participants each year). While Techday is usually reserved for professional, established startups, the people at Techday have <b>made an exception for high schoolers to attend for the first time!</b></div><a href="http://dogecache.com" target="_blank" class="button">Visit Dogecache</a>',
  "Research" : '<div style="margin-bottom:20px">Last summer, I conducted independent research at <b>Rutgers University</b> on the creation of mathematical models for predicting the efficiency of railguns. My research was awarded 2nd place out of over 120 applicants in the by the <b>Armed Forces Electronics and Communications Association</b> as part of the statewide competition, Monmouth Junior Science Symposium. In addition, I received a special award by the Navy in recognition for my work and was invited to the <b>Naval Research Base</b> in Washington, D.C. to tour the facility and discuss the continuation of my research with a grant from them. Naval researchers who have read my paper also have expressed interest to cite and reference my work in their own future studies.</div><a href="pdf/railgun-abstract.pdf" target="_blank" class="button">View the abstract</a>',
  "Robotics" : 'Last March, my team and I won <b>two 1st place awards</b> in the state level of an international competition called VEX Robotics, sponsored by the Technology Student Association (TSA). The competitions consisted of various themed challenges based around automated “pick and place” tasks. One of the awards was from getting the highest score in an individual trial of completing the tasks, and the other was from winning the team battles, where two robots ally as one team against another to score the highest points. My school’s team will be <b>participating in VEX Robotics at TSA’s national conference in June.</b>',

Electronic music is one of my most meaningful past times, and this song is a culmination of my emotions and feelings in the past few weeks. It has definitely been a joy producing this song, and I hope to finish it in the near future. But until then, please take a listen to this 1 minute preview!'
