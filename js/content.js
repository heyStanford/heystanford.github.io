  "Hackathon" : '<div style="margin-bottom:20px">I went to a hackathon at Bergen County Academies, a high school in NJ, with my friends last March. Like any other hackathon, the objective was to create any app as you please. My friends and I created an app called Dogecache, a spin-off of Geocaching. Geocaching is a global scavenger hunt where people look for objects that others have dropped, and at the same time they drop off objects to continue the cycle. Dogecache holds a similar concept but with the new electronic currency Dogecoin. In the app, the user can search for dogecoin other people have dropped within a certain radius of their location. Then, they drop off a certain amount of their choice at their current location so others can find it. This app won the special "Most Polished App" award, and the "Best Quality Mobile Web App" as awarded by Intel. Our team was also invited to exhibit our app at Techday in New York City, the largest startup event in the area (with over 10,000 participants each year)! </div><a href="http://dogecache.com" target="_blank" class="button">Visit Dogecache</a>',
  "Research" : '<div style="margin-bottom:20px">I conducted research over the summer at the Rutgers University Physics Department under Dr. Seongshik Oh. There, I did independent research on creating a mathematical model for predicting the efficiency of a railgun and entered my research paper as an entry in the state-wide Monmouth Junior Science Symposium in New Jersey. Out of the 10 selected paper presenters of over 120 applicants, I awarded the 2nd place paper by the Armed Forces Electronics and Communications Association. In addition, I also received a special award by the Navy in recognition for my work on railguns and was personally invited to the Naval Research Base in Washington, D.C. to have a tour there and possibly continue my research under a grant. Naval researchers who have read my paper also have expressed interest to cite and reference my work in their own future studies. As of right now, I am still planning the visit to the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C. and hope to discuss future plans with my research there.</div><a href="pdf/railgun-abstract.pdf" target="_blank" class="button">View the abstract</a>',
  "Robotics" : 'Last March, I participated as part of the Technology Student Association (TSA) competitions, which are engineering-based high school level competitions. TSA has one competition called VEX Robotics, which is an already existing competition that reaches up to the international level. While the tasks change every year, the competitions are usually themed on picking up different objects around a flat field and placing them in designated areas. VEX had two mini-competitions this year in my state-level TSA competition. One was a Robot Skills, a time trial where each team tried to individually score as high as they can by strategically placing objects around the course, and the other was Head-to-Head, a team battle where two teams (two robots per team) try to score objects in their own areas while de-scoring the other team. My team won 1st in both sub-competitions in the TSA state competition and was invited to participate in the national TSA competition for VEX Robotics.',

I mentioned before in my application that making electronic music is one of my most meaningful past times, and this song is a culmination of my emotions and feelings in the past few weeks. Itâ€™s definitely a joy producing this song, and I hope to finish it in the near future. Meanwhile, I hope you will have time to at least listen to part of the song. I know that admissions officers are always busy with the myriad of applications and tasks to complete around them, so it would mean a great deal if you took the time to play this 1 minute preview.'
