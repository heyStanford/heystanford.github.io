  "Hackathon" : '<div style="margin-bottom:20px">On March 22 and 23, my friends and I attended hackBCA, a hackathon at Bergen County Academies High School, NJ. The product of our efforts there culminated into an app we call <b>Dogecache</b>, a spin-off of the popular activity Geocaching. Geocaching is a global scavenger hunt where players look for objects that others have dropped and acquire them, but they must also leave behind one of their possessions to allow other players to hunt for them, thus continuing the cycle. Dogecache replaces these objects with the <b>popular electronic crypto-currency, Dogecoin</b>, which is very similar to Bitcoin. With the Dogecahce app, a player can choose to search an area around them for dogecoin. If they find any, they keep it, but for every search, they must drop off a certain amount of dogecoin at their current location so others can find it. This app won the special <b>"Most Polished App"</b> award and the <b>"Best Quality Mobile Web App"</b> as awarded by Intel and a panel of judges including Alex Ohanion, cofounder of Reddit, and Colin Kroll, cofounder of Vine! Our team was also invited to exhibit our app at NY Techday in New York City, the largest startup event in the world (with over 400 companies and 10,000 participants each year). While Techday is usually reserved for professional, established companies, like Uber, CollegeHumor, and Grooveshark, the coordinators at Techday have <b>made an exception for the Dogecache team to represent the first high schoolers to exhibit!</b> At NY Techday on April 24, over 400 attendees came to Dogecache\'s booth, where my teammates and I explained the app concept and aroused interest in the crowd. Dogecache\'s <b>user base doubled within 10 hours</b> during the event, and the app also <b>received lots of press, featured in articles on <a href="http://spelunk.in/2014/04/24/dogecache-geocaching-meets-dogecoin-in-an-app-created-by-teens/" target="_blank">Spelunk.in</a>, <a href="http://launch.it/launch/first-high-school-students-at-techday-nyc-to-exhibit-dogecoin-powered-app-dogecache" target="_blank">Launch.it</a>, and <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dogecache-is-geocaching-for-dogecoins" target="_blank">on Motherboard @ Vice</a> (Vice is a very popular and internationally recognized news site!).</b> Future plans for Dogecache include continuing getting word out to the public and refining the app to maximize its fun and enjoyability.</div><a href="http://dogecache.com" target="_blank" class="button">Visit Dogecache</a>',
  "Research" : '<div class="pics-wrapper"><div class="pic" style="background-image:url(img/railgun-1.jpg)"></div><div class="pic" style="background-image:url(img/railgun-2.jpg)"></div><div class="pic" style="background-image:url(img/railgun-3.jpg)"></div><div class="pic" style="background-image:url(img/railgun-4.jpg)"></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:20px">Last summer, I conducted research at <b>the Physics Department in Rutgers University</b>. I worked on a project independent from my mentor\'s ongoing project. Over there, I created a mathematical model, based on second-order differential equations, for predicting the efficiency of railguns. The motive behind this was that there currently is no standard model for predicting railgun performance efficiency according to literature, and I wanted to make the first step towards changing that. My research was awarded 2nd place by the <b>Armed Forces Electronics and Communications Association</b> out of the 120+ applicants of the statewide competition, Monmouth Junior Science Symposium. In addition, I received a special award by the Navy in recognition for my work and was invited to the <b>Naval Research Laboratory</b> in Washington, D.C. to tour the facility. Naval researchers who have read my paper have suggested the continuation of my research under a grant from them, and they have also expressed interest in citing and referencing my work in their own future studies.</div><a href="pdf/railgun-abstract.pdf" target="_blank" class="button">View the abstract</a>',

State-level VEX Robotics was sponsored by the Technology Student Association (TSA). The competitions consisted of various themed challenges based around automated “pick and place” tasks, and in VEX Robotics, optimization of the robot and proper practice on the course are key parts to success. During the past few months before the competition, my team and I worked diligently and hard to prepare a versatile, unique robot that could win - and the work paid off. One of the 1st place awards was from individual robot trials, where each robot is on the course by itself and does whatever it takes to pick and place objects for the highest score. The other award was from winning a team tournament, where two robots ally as one team against another team. Each team tries to score their own objects while de-scoring the other team’s objects by removing them from the designated areas. My team will be <b>participating in VEX Robotics at TSA’s National Conference in late June.</b></div>',

Electronic music is one of my most meaningful past times, and this song is a culmination of my emotions and feelings in the past few weeks. It has definitely been a joy producing this song, called <b>”Elixir”</b> and I hope to finish it in the near future. But until then, please take a listen to this 1 minute preview!'
